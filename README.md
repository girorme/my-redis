This is a starting point for Elixir solutions to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, you'll build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Timeline

- PR: Improving connection handling (https://github.com/girorme/my-redis/pull/1)

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `mix` installed locally
1. Run `./spawn_redis_server.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented
   in `lib/server.ex`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
